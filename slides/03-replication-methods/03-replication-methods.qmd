# What is considered a successful or unsuccessful replication? {.question .smaller}

# Some (random) concepts {.section}

## Some (random) concepts

> Credibility of scientific claims is established with evidence for their replicability using new data [@Nosek2020-vh]

> Replication is repeating a studyâ€™s procedure and observing whether the prior finding recurs [@Jeffreys1973-bp]

> Replication is a study for which any outcome would be considered diagnostic evidence about a claim from prior research [@Nosek2020-vh].

## Difficulty in drawing conclusions from replications

Replication is often intended as *conditioned* to the original result. The original result could be a false positive or a biased result. Also the replication attempt could be a false positive or a false negative [@Nosek2020-vh].

. . .

> To be a replication, two things must be true. Outcomes consistent with a prior claim would increase confidence in the claim, and outcomes inconsistent with a prior claim would decrease confidence in the claim [@Nosek2020-vh].

. . .

This is somehow similar with a Bayesian reasoning where evidence about a phenomenon is updated after collecting more data.

## Exact and Conceptual replications

Exact replications are commonly considered as the *gold-standard* but in practice (especially in Social Sciences, Psychology, etc.) are rare.

Let's imagine, an original study $y_{or}$ finding a result.

- Replication $y_{rep}$ with the *exact* same method find the same result. **Replication or not?**
- Replication $y_{rep}$ with a *similar* method find the same result. **Replication or not?**
- Replication $y_{rep}$ with *similar* method did not find the same result. **Replication or not?**

## Direct and Conceptual replications [@Schmidt2009-mq]

A **direct replication** is defined as the repetition of an experimental procedure.

A **conceptual replication** is defined as testing the same hypothesis with different methods.

## Exact replications are (often) impossible [@Schmidt2009-mq]

Let's imagine an extreme example: **testing the physiological reaction to arousing situation**:

- The original study: Experiment with prehistoric reacting to an arousing stimulus
- The actual replication: It is possible to create the exact situation? Some phenomenon changes overtime, especially people-related phenomenon

Exact replication is often not feasible. Even using the same experimental setup (*direct replication*) does not assure that we are studying the same phenomenon.

## As Exact as possible...

Even when an experiment use almost the same setup of the original study there is a source of unknown uncertainty. Which is the impact of a slightly change in the experimental setup on the actual result?

- A study on the human visual system: presenting stimuli on different monitors --> small change with a huge impact
- A study on consumer behavior: participant answering question using a smartphone or a computer --> small but (maybe) irrelevant change

How to evaluate the actual impact?

# What we are going to do? {.section}

## What we are (not) going to do?

. . .

- I will not present a strictly theoretical and philosophical approach to replication (*what is a replication?*, *what is the most appropriate definition?*, etc.). But we can discuss it together :smile:!

. . .

- According to the replication definitions and problems, we will explore some **statistical** methods to evaluate a replication success

# Overall model and notation {.section}

## Overall model and notation

For the purpose of notation and simplicity we can define a meta-analytical-based replication model [@Hedges2019-ry; @Schauer2021-ja; @Schauer2022-mj]

$$
y_i = \mu_{\theta} + \delta_i + \epsilon_i
$$

$$
\delta_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \tau^2)
$$

$$
\epsilon_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2_i)
$$

## Overall model and notation {.smaller}

- Thus each study $i$ out of the number of studies $k$.
- $\mu_{\theta}$ is the real average effect
- $\mu_{\theta} + \delta_i$ is the real effect of each study where $\delta_i$ is the study-specific deviation from the overall effect
- $\tau^2$ is the real variance among different studies. When $\tau^2 = 0$ there is no variability among studies
- $\epsilon_i$ are the sampling errors that depends on $\sigma^2_i$, the sampling variability of each study (i.e., how imprecise is the estimation). $\sigma^2_i$ (that depends on the study variance and sample size) determine how precise is the estimation of each $\mu_{\theta} + \delta_i$.
- With $\theta_i$ we define the study specific effect i.e. $\mu_{\theta} + \delta_i$ for simplicity
- The observed effect $y_i$ is an estimate of $\theta_i$
- We define $\theta_{orig}$ (or $\theta_1$) as the original study and $\theta_{rep_i}$ (with $i$ from 2 to $k$) as the replication studies 

## Overall model and notation

For the examples we are going to simulate (unstandardized) effect sizes (see Slide "Extra - Simulating Meta-Analysis" of the meta-analysis workshop). Basically:

$$
\Delta = \overline{X_1} - \overline{X_2}
$$

$$
SE_{\Delta} = \sqrt{\frac{s^2_1}{n_1} + \frac{s^2_2}{n_2}}
$$

With $X_{1_j} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ and $X_{2_j} \sim \mathcal{N}(\Delta, 1)$

continue...

## Overall model and notation

Thus our observed effect sizes $y_i$ is sampled from:
$$
y_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_\theta, \tau^2 + \frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2})
$$

Where $\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2}$ is the sampling variability ($\sigma^2_i$).

The sampling variances are sampled from:

$$
\sigma_i^2 \sim \frac{\chi^2_{n_1 + n_2 - 2}}{n_1 + n_2 - 2} (\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2})
$$

## Overall model and notation

Everything is implemented into the `sim_studies()` function:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: asis
filor::print_fun(funs_meta$sim_studies)
```

```{r}
sim_studies(k = 10, theta = 0.5, tau2 = 0.1, n0 = 30, n1 = 30)
```

## Exact vs Approximate replication

This distinction [see @Brandt2014-da for a different terminology] refers to parameters $\theta_i$. With *exact* are considering a case where:

$$
\theta_1 = \theta_2 = \theta_3, \dots, \theta_k
$$

Thus the true parameters of $k$ replication studies are the same. Thus the variability among true effects $\tau^2 = 0$.

Similarly, due to (often not controllable) differences among experiments (i.e., lab, location, sample, etc.) we could expect a certain degree of variability $\tau^2$. In other terms $\tau^2 < \tau^2_0$ where $\tau^2_0$ is the maximum variability (that need to be defined). In this way studies are replicating:

$$
\theta_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_\theta, \tau^2_0)
$$

## Types of agreement

Coarsely, we can define a replication success when two or more studies obtain the "same" result. The definion of *sameness* it is crucial:

- same *sign* or direction: two studies (original and replication) evaluating the efficacy of a treatment have a positive effect $sign(\theta_1) = sign(\theta_2)$ where $sign$ is the sign function.
- same *magnitude*: two studies (original and replication) evaluating the efficacy of a treatment have the same effect in terms $|\theta_1 - \theta_2| = 0$ or similar up to a tolerance factor $|\theta_1 - \theta_2| < \gamma$ where $\gamma$ is the maximum difference considered as null.

The different methods that we are going to see are focused on a specific type of aggreement. For example, we could consider $\theta_1 = 3x$ and $\theta_2 = x$ to have the same sign but the replication study is on a completely different scale. Is this considered a successful replication?

## Falsification vs Consistency

. . .

This refers to how the replication setup is formulated. With $k = 2$ studies where $k_1$ is the original study and $k_2$ is the replication we have a *one-to-one* setup. In this setup we compare the replication with the original and according to the chosen method and expectation we conclude if $k_1$ has been replicated or not.

. . .

When $k > 2$ we could collapse the replication studies into a single value (e.g., using a meta-analysis method) and compare the results using a *one-to-one* or we can use a method for *one-to-many* designs.

. . .

Regardless the method, *falsification* approaches compared the original with the replicate(s) obtaining a yes-no answer or a continuous result. On the other side *consistency* methods are focused on evaluating the degree of similarity (i.e., consistency) among all studies.

# Statistical Methods {.section}

## Statistical Methods, disclaimer [@Schauer2021-ja]

- There are no unique methods to assess replication from a statistical point of view
- For available statistical methods, statistical properties (e.g., type-1 error rate, power, bias, etc.) are not always known or extensively examined
- Different methods answers to the same question or to different replication definitions

# Frequentists Methods {.section}

## Vote Counting based on significance or direction

The simplest method is called **vote counting** [@Valentine2011-yq; @Hedges1980-gd]. A replication attempt $\theta_{rep}$ is considered successful if the result has the same direction of the original study $\theta_{orig}$ and it is statistically significant i.e., $p_{\theta_{rep}} \leq \alpha$. Similarly we can count the number of replication with the *same sign* as the original study.

:::{.pros}
- Easy to understand, communicate and compute
:::

:::{.cons}
- Did not consider the size of the effect
- Depends on the power of $\theta_{rep}$
:::

## Example with simulated data

Let's simulate an exact replication:

```{r}
## original study
n_orig <- 30
theta_orig <- theta_from_z(2, n_orig)

orig <- data.frame(
  yi = theta_orig,
  vi = 4/(n_orig*2)
)

orig$sei <- sqrt(orig$vi)
orig <- summary_es(orig)

orig

## replications

k <- 10
reps <- sim_studies(k = k, theta = theta_orig, tau2 = 0, n_orig, n_orig, summary = TRUE)

head(reps)
```

## Example with simulated data

Let's compute the proportions of replication studies are statistically significant:

```{r}
mean(reps$pval <= 0.05)
```

Let's compute the proportions of replication studies with the same sign as the original:

```{r}
mean(sign(orig$yi) == sign(reps$yi))
```

We could also perform some statistical tests. See @Bushman2009-zv and @Hedges1980-gd for vote-counting methods in meta-analysis.

## Vote Counting, extreme example

```{r, include = FALSE}
z_orig <- 2
n_orig <- 30

# z = g1/sqrt(4/(n_orig*2))
theta_orig <- theta_from_z(z_orig, n_orig)

2 * pnorm(z_orig, lower.tail = FALSE)

n_rep <- 350
theta_rep <- 0.15

z_rep <- theta_rep/sqrt(4/(n_rep * 2))
2 * pnorm(z_rep, lower.tail = FALSE)
```

Let's imagine an original experiment with $n_{orig} = 30$ and $\hat \theta_{orig} = 0.5$ that is statistically significant $p \approx 0.045$. Now a direct replication (thus assuming $\tau^2 = 0$) study with $n_{rep} = 350$ found $\hat \theta_{rep_1} = 0.15$, that is statistically significant $p\approx 0.047$.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
se_rep <- sqrt(4/(n_rep*2))
curve(dnorm(x, theta_rep, se_rep), -0.2, 0.7, 
      main = "Can be considered as a successful replication?",
      ylab = "Density", 
      xlab = latex2exp::TeX("$\\theta$"))
abline(v = theta_rep + qnorm(c(0.025, 0.975)) * se_rep, lty = "dashed")
points(theta_orig, 0, pch = 19, cex = 2)
points(theta_rep, 0, pch = 19, cex = 2, col = "firebrick")
text(theta_orig, 1, labels = "Original Study")
text(theta_rep, 1, labels = "Replication Study")
```

## Confidence Interval, replication within original

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Theory

Another approach check if the replication attempt $\theta_{rep}$ is contained in the % confidence interval of the original study $\theta_{orig}$. Formally:

$$
\theta_{orig} - \Phi(\alpha/2) \sqrt{\sigma^2_{orig}} < \theta_{rep} < \theta_{orig} + \Phi(\alpha/2) \sqrt{\sigma^2_{orig}}
$$

Where $\Phi$ is the cumulative standard normal distribution, $\alpha$ is the type-1 error rate.

:::{.pros}
- Take into account the size of the effect and the precision of $\theta_{orig}$
:::
:::{.cons}
- The original study is assumed to be a reliable estimation
- No extension for *many-to-one* designs
- Low precise original studies lead to higher success rate
:::

### R Code

```{r echo = FALSE}
se_orig <- sqrt(4 / (2 * n_orig))
ci_orig <- theta_orig + qnorm(c(0.025, 0.975)) * se_orig
curve(dnorm(x, theta_orig, se_orig), 
      -1, 2, 
      ylab = "Density", 
      xlab = latex2exp::TeX("$\\theta$"))
abline(v = ci_orig, lty = "dashed")
points(theta_orig, 0, pch = 19, cex = 2)
points(theta_rep, 0, pch = 19, cex = 2, col = "firebrick")
legend("topleft", 
       legend = c("Original", "Replication"), 
       fill = c("black", "firebrick"))
```

:::

## Confidence Interval, replication within original

One potential problem of this method regards that low precise original studies are "easier" to replicate due to larger confidence intervals. 

```{r}
#| echo: false
theta_orig <- 0.5

ci_plot <- data.frame(
  yi = 0.5,
  ni = c(200, 50, 10)
)

ci_plot$sei <- sqrt(4 / (2 * ci_plot$ni))

ci_plot$lower <- ci_plot$yi + qnorm(0.025)*ci_plot$sei
ci_plot$upper <- ci_plot$yi + qnorm(0.975)*ci_plot$sei

curve(dnorm(x, ci_plot$yi[1], ci_plot$sei[1]), -1, 2, 
      ylab = "Density", 
      xlab = latex2exp::TeX("$\\theta$"), col = 1, lwd = 2)

curve(dnorm(x, ci_plot$yi[2], ci_plot$sei[2]), -1, 2, 
      ylab = "Density", 
      xlab = latex2exp::TeX("$\\theta$"), col = 2, lwd = 2,
      add = TRUE)

curve(dnorm(x, ci_plot$yi[3], ci_plot$sei[3]), -1, 2, 
      ylab = "Density", 
      xlab = latex2exp::TeX("$\\theta$"), col = 3, lwd = 2,
      add = TRUE)

legend("topleft", 
       legend = c("N = 10", "N = 50", "N = 200"), 
       fill = 3:1)

abline(v = ci_plot$lower, lty = "dashed", col = 1:3)
abline(v = ci_plot$upper, lty = "dashed", col = 1:3)

points(theta_orig, 0, pch = 19, cex = 2)
points(0.1, 0, pch = 19, cex = 2, col = "firebrick")
legend("topright", 
       legend = c("Original", "Replication"), 
       fill = c("black", "firebrick"))
```

## Confidence Interval, original within replication

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Theory

The same approach can be applied checking if the original effect size is contained within the replication confidence interval. Clearly these methods depends on the precision of studies. Formally:

$$
\theta_{rep} - \Phi(\alpha/2) \sqrt{\sigma_{rep}^2} < \theta_{orig} < \theta_{rep} + \Phi(\alpha/2) \sqrt{\sigma_{rep}^2}
$$

The method has the same pros and cons of the previous approach. One advantage is that usually replication studies are more precise (higher sample size) thus the parameter and the % CI is more reliable.

```{r echo = FALSE}
ci_rep <- theta_rep + qnorm(c(0.025, 0.975)) * se_rep

## Prediction interval (PI), what to expect from a replication

One problem of the previous approaches is taking into account only the uncertainty of the original or the replication study. @Patil2016-vc and @Spence2016-tz proposed a method to take into account both sources of uncertainty.

If the original and replication studies comes from the same population, the sampling distribution of the difference is centered on 0 with a certain standard error $\theta_{orig} - \theta_{rep_0} \sim \mathcal{N}\left( 0, \sqrt{\sigma^2_{\hat \theta_{orig} - \hat \theta_{rep}}} \right)$ (subscript $0$ to indicate that is expected to be sampled from the same population as $\theta_{orig}$)

$$
\hat \theta_{orig} \pm z_{95\%} \sqrt{\sigma^2_{\theta_{orig} - \theta_{rep}}}
$$

If factors other than standard error influence the replication result, $\theta_{rep_0}$  is not expected to be contained within the 95% prediction interval.

## Prediction interval (PI), what to expect from a replication

In the case of a (un)standardized mean difference we can compute the prediction interval as:

$$
\sqrt{\sigma^2_{\epsilon_{\hat \theta_{orig} - \hat \theta_{rep_0}}}} = \sqrt{\left( \frac{\hat \sigma^2_{o1}}{n_{o1}} +\frac{\hat \sigma^2_{o2}}{n_{o2}}\right) + \left(\frac{\hat \sigma^2_{o1}}{n_{r1}} + \frac{\hat\sigma^2_{o2}}{n_{r2}}\right)}
$$

The first term is just the standard error of the difference between the two groups in the original study and the second term is the standard error of the **hypothetical** replication study assuming the same standard deviation of the original but a different $n$.

In this way we estimate an interval where, combining sampling variance from both studies and assuming that they comes from the same population, the replication should fall.

## Mathur & VanderWeele [-@Mathur2020-nw] $p_{orig}$

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Theory

Mathur & VanderWeele [-@Mathur2020-nw] proposed a new method based on the prediction interval to calculate a p value $p_{orig}$ representing the probability that $\theta_{orig}$ is consistent with the replications. This method is suited for *many-to-one* replication designs. Formally:

$$
P_{orig} = 2 \left[ 1 - \Phi \left( \frac{|\hat \theta_{orig} - \hat \mu_{\theta_{rep}}|}{\sqrt{\hat \tau^2 + \sigma^2_{orig} + \hat{SE}^2_{\hat \mu_{\theta_{rep}}}}} \right) \right]
$$

- $\mu_{\theta_{rep}}$ is the pooled (i.e., meta-analytic) estimation of the $k$ replications
- $\tau^2$ is the variance among replications

### Pros-cons

It is interpreted as the probability that $\theta_{orig}$ is equal or more extreme that what observed. A very low $p_{orig}$ suggest that the original study is inconsistent with replications.

:::{.pros}
- Suited for *many-to-one* designs
- We take into account all sources of uncertainty
- We have a p-value
:::

### R Code

The code is implemented in the `Replicate` and `MetaUtility` R packages:

```{r, include = FALSE}
sim_studies <- function(k, theta, tau2, n0, n1){
  yi <- rnorm(k, theta, sqrt(tau2 + 1/n0 + 1/n1))
  vi <- (rchisq(k, n0 + n1 - 2) / (n0 + n1 - 2)) * (1/n0 + 1/n1)
  data.frame(yi, vi, sei = sqrt(vi))
}
```

```{r}
tau2 <- 0.05
theta_rep <- 0.2

n_orig <- 30
n_rep <- 100
k <- 20

replications <- sim_studies(k, theta_rep, tau2, n_rep, n_rep)
original <- sim_studies(1, theta_orig, 0, n_orig, n_orig)

## Mathur & VanderWeele [-@Mathur2020-nw] $\hat P_{> 0}$

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Theory

Another related metric is the $\hat P_{> 0}$, representing the proportion of replications following the same direction as the original effect. Before simply computing the proportions we need to adjust the estimated $\theta_{rep_i}$ with a shrinkage factor:

$$
\tilde{\theta}_{rep_i} = (\theta_{rep_i} - \mu_{\theta_{rep_i}}) \sqrt{\frac{\hat \tau^2}{\hat \tau^2 + v_{rep_i}}}
$$

This method is somehow similar to the vote counting but we are adjusting the effects taking into account $\tau^2$.

### R Code

```{r}
# compute calibrated estimation for the replications
# use restricted maximum likelihood to estimate tau2 under the hood
theta_sh <- MetaUtility::calib_ests(replications$yi, replications$sei, method = "REML")
mean(theta_sh > 0)
```

### Bootstrap Code

The authors suggest a bootstrapping approach for making inference on $\hat P_{> 0}$

```{r}
nboot <- 1e4
theta_boot <- matrix(0, nrow = nboot, ncol = k)

for(i in 1:nboot){
  idx <- sample(1:nrow(replications), nrow(replications), replace = TRUE)
  replications_boot <- replications[idx, ]
  theta_cal <- MetaUtility::calib_ests(replications_boot$yi, 
                                       replications_boot$sei, 
                                       method = "REML")
  theta_boot[i, ] <- theta_cal
}

# calculate
p_greater_boot <- apply(theta_boot, 1, function(x) mean(x > 0))
```

### Bootstrap Results

```{r}
#| echo: false
hist(p_greater_boot,
     xlab = latex2exp::TeX("$\\hat{P}_{> 0}$"),
     breaks = 10,

     main = latex2exp::TeX("Bootstrapped $\\hat{P}_{> 0}$"))
abline(v = quantile(p_greater_boot, c(0.025, 0.975)))

## Mathur & VanderWeele [-@Mathur2020-nw] $\hat P_{\gtrless q*}$

Instead of using 0 as threshold, we can use meaningful effect size to be considered as low but different from 0. $\hat P_{\gtrless q*}$ is the proportion of (calibrated) replications greater or lower than the $q*$ value. This framework is similar to equivalence and minimum effect size testing [@Lakens2018-ri].

```{r}
q <- 0.2 # minimum non zero effect

fit <- metafor::rma(yi, vi, data = replications)

# see ?MetaUtility::prop_stronger
MetaUtility::prop_stronger(q = q,
                           M = fit$b[[1]],
                           t2 = fit$tau2,
                           tail = "above",
                           estimate.method = "calibrated",
                           ci.method = "calibrated",
                           dat = replications,
                           yi.name = "yi",
                           vi.name = "vi")
```

## Combining original and replications

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Theory

Another approach is to combine the original and replication results (both *one-to-one* and *many-to-one*) using a meta-analysis model. Then we can test if the pooled estimate is different from 0 or another meaningful value.

:::{.pros}
- Use all the available information, especially when fitting a random-effects model
- Take into account the precision by inverse-variance weighting
:::

:::{.cons}
- Did not consider the publication bias
- For *one-to-one* designs only a fixed-effects model can be used
:::

### Fixed-effects Model

```{r}
# fixed-effects
fit_fixed <- rma(yi, vi, method = "FE")
summary(fit_fixed)
```

### Random-Effects model

```{r}
# fixed-effects
fit_random <- rma(yi, vi, method = "REML")
summary(fit_random)
```

### Pooling replications

The previous approach can be also implemented combining replications into a single effect and then compare the original with the combined replication study.

This is similar to using the CI or PI approaches but the replication effect will probably by very precise due to pooling multiple studies.

## Q Statistics 

An interesting proposal is using the Q statistics [@Hedges2019-pr; @Hedges2019-ar; @Hedges2021-of; @Schauer2022-mj; @Schauer2021-ja; @Schauer2020-tw; @Hedges2019-ry], commonly used in meta-analysis to assess the presence of heterogeneity. Formally:

$$
Q = \sum_{i = 1}^{k} \frac{(\theta_i - \bar \theta_w)^2}{\sigma^2_i}
$$

Where $\bar \theta_w$ is the inverse-variance weighted average (i.g., fixed-effect model). The Q statistics is essentially a weighted sum of squares. Under the null hypothesis where all studies are equal $\theta_1 = \theta_2, ... = \theta_i$ the Q statistics has a $\chi^2$ distribution with $k - 1$ degrees of freedom. Under the alternative hypothesis the distribution is a non-central $\chi^2$ with non centrality parameter $\lambda$. The expected value of the $Q$ is $E(Q) = v + \lambda$, where $v$ are the degrees of freedom.

## Q Statistics 

Hedges & Schauer proposed to use the Q statistics to evaluate the consistency of a series of replications:

- In case of *exact* replication, $\lambda = 0$ because $\theta_1 = \theta_2, ... = \theta_k$.
- In case of *approximate* replication, $\lambda < \lambda_0$ where $\lambda_0$ is the maximum value considered as equal to null (i.e., 0).

This approach is testing the consistency (i.e., homogeneity) of replications. A successful replication should minimize the heterogeneity and the presence of a significant Q statistics should bring evidence for not replicating the effect^[The approach has been debated by a series of opinion papers [see @Hedges2019-pr; @Mathur2019-vh]].

## Q Statistics

The method has been expanded and formalized in several papers with different objectives:

. . .

- to cover different replications setup (burden of proof on replicating vs non-replicating, many-to-one and one-to-one, etc.)

. . .

- interpret and choose the $\lambda$ parameter given that is the core of the approach

. . .

- evaluating the power and statistical properties under different replication scenarios

. . .

- the standard implementation put the burden of proof on non-replication. Thus $H_0$ is that studies replicates. They provided also a series of tests with the opposite formulation.

## Q Statistics

In the case of evaluating an exact replication we can use the `Qrep()` function that simply calculate the p-value based on the Q sampling distribution.

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Function

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: asis
filor::print_fun(funs$Qrep)
```

### Code

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
dat <- sim_studies(100, 0.5, 0.1, 50, 50)
Qres <- Qrep(dat$yi, dat$vi)
```

```{r}
Qres <- Qrep(dat$yi, dat$vi)
```

### Plot

```{r}
plot.Qrep(Qres)
```

:::

## Q Statistics

- In case of approximate replication we need to set $\lambda_0$ to a meaningful value but the overall test is the same. The critical $Q$ is no longer evaluated with a central $\chi^2$ but a non-central $\chi^2$ with $\lambda_0$ as non-centrality parameter.

- @Hedges2019-ry provide different strategies to choose $\lambda_0$. They found that under some assumptions, $\lambda = (k - 1) \frac{\tau^2}{\tilde{v}}$

- Given that we introduced the $I^2$ statistics we can derive a $\lambda_0$ based in $I^2$. @Schmidt2014-kw proposed that when $\tilde{v}$ is at least 75% of total variance $\tilde{v} + \tau^2$ thus $\tau^2$ could be considered neglegible. This corresponds to a $I^2 = 25%$ and a ratio $\frac{\tau^2}{\tilde{v}} = 1/3$ thus $\lambda_0 = \frac{(k - 1)}{3}$ can be considered a neglegible heterogeneity

```{r}
k <- 100
dat <- sim_studies(k, 0.5, 0, 50, 50)
Qrep(dat$yi, dat$vi, lambda0 = (k - 1)/3)
```

## Small Telescopes [@Simonsohn2015-kg]

Simonsohn [-@Simonsohn2015-kg] introduced 3 main questions when evaluating replicability:

. . .

1. When we combine data from the original and replication study, what is our best guess of the overall effect?

. . .

**meta-analysis**

. . .

2. Is the effect of the replication study different from the original study?

. . .

**meta-analysis** and standard tests, but problematic in terms of statistical power

. . .

3. Does the replication study suggest that the effect of interest is undetectable different from zero?

. . .

**small telescopes**

## Small Telescopes [@Simonsohn2015-kg]

The idea is simple but quite powerful and insightful. Let's assume that an original study found an effect of $y_{orig} = 0.7$ on a two-sample design with $n = 20$ per group.

. . .

- we define a threshold as the effect size that is associated with a certain low power level e.g., $33\%$ given the sample size i.e. $\theta_{small} = 0.5$
- the replication study found an effect of $y{rep} = 0.2$ with $n = 100$ subjects

. . .

If the $y_{rep}$ is lower (i.e., the upper bound of the confidence interval) than the *small effect* ($\theta_{small} = 0.5$) we conclude that the effect is probably so low that could not have been detected by the original study. Thus there is no evidence for a replication.
    
## Small Telescopes [@Simonsohn2015-kg]

We can use the custom `small_telescope()` function on simulated data:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: asis
filor::print_fun(funs$small_telescope)
```

## Small Telescopes [@Simonsohn2015-kg]

```{r}
#| echo: true
set.seed(2025)

d <- 0.2 # real effect

# original study
or_n <- 20
or_d <- 0.7
or_se <- sqrt(1/20 + 1/20)
d_small <- pwr::pwr.t.test(or_n, power = 0.33)$d

# replication
rep_n <- 100 # sample size of replication study
g0 <- rnorm(rep_n, 0, 1)
g1 <- rnorm(rep_n, d, 1)

rep_d <- mean(g1) - mean(g0)
rep_se <- sqrt(var(g1)/rep_n + var(g0)/rep_n)
```

Here we are using the `pwr::pwr.t.test()` to compute the effect size $\theta_{small}$ (in code `d`) associated with 33% power.

## Small Telescopes [@Simonsohn2015-kg]

```{r}
small_telescope(or_d, or_se, rep_d, rep_se, d_small, ci = 0.95)
```

And a (quite over-killed) plot:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
quiet(small_telescope(or_d, or_se, rep_d, rep_se, d_small, ci = 0.95)) |> 
  telescope_plot()
```

# Bayesian Methods {.section}

## Bayes Factor

@Verhagen2014-tx proposed a method to estimate the evidence of a *replication* study. The core topics to understand the method are:

- Bayesian hypothesis testing using the Bayes Factor [see, @Rouder2009-jh]
- Bayes Factor using the Savage-Dickey density ratio [SDR, @Wagenmakers2010-fj]

## Bayesian inference

Bayesian inference is the statistical procedure where **prior beliefs** about a phenomenon are combined, using the Bayes theorem, with **evidence from data** to obtain the **posterior beliefs**. 

. . .

The interesting part is that the researcher express the prior beliefs in probabilistic terms. Then after collecting data, evidence from the experiment is combined increasing or decreasing the plausibility of prior beliefs.

. . .

Let's make an (not a very innovative :smile:) example. We need to evaluate the fairness of a coin. The crucial parameter is $\theta$ that is the probability of success (e.g., head). We have our prior belief about the coin (e.g., fair but with some uncertainty). We toss the coin $k$ times and we observe $x$ heads. What are my conclusions?

## Bayesian inference

$$
p(\theta|D) = \frac{p(D|\theta) \; p(\theta)}{p(D)}
$$
Where $\theta$ is our parameter and $D$ the data. $p(\theta|D)$ is the posterior distribution that is the product between the likelihood $p(D|\theta)$ and the prior $p(\theta)$. $p(D)$ is the probability of the data (aka marginal likelihood) and is necessary only for the posterior to be a proper probability distribution.

We can "read" the formula as: *The probability of the parameter given the data is the product between the likelihood of the data given the parameter and the prior probability of the parameter*.

## Bayesian inference

Let's express our **prior** belief in probabilistic terms:

```{r}
#| echo: false

k = 50 # number of trials
x = 0:k # theta
p = x/k # p
d = 40 # observed data

prior = dbeta(p, 15, 15) 
likelihood = dbinom(d, k, p)
posterior = (prior * likelihood) / sum(prior * likelihood)

prior = prior / sum(prior)
likelihood = likelihood/ sum(likelihood)

ylim = c(0, max(c(prior, likelihood, posterior)))

plot(p, prior, 
     type = "l", 
     ylim = ylim, 
     lwd = 2, 
     xlab = latex2exp::TeX("$\\theta$"), 
     ylab = "Probability")
```

## Bayesian inference

Now we collect data and we observe $x = 40$ tails out of $k = 50$ trials thus $\hat{\theta} = 0.8$ and compute the *likelihood*:

```{r}
#| echo: false

plot(p, prior, 
     type = "l", 
     ylim = ylim, 
     lwd = 2, 
     xlab = latex2exp::TeX("$\\theta$"), 
     ylab = "Probability", col = "darkgreen")
lines(p, likelihood, col = "black", lwd = 2)
points(d/k, 0, pch = 19, col = "firebrick", cex = 1.5)
```

## Bayesian inference

Finally we combine, using the Bayes rule, **prior** and **likelihood** to obtain the **posterior** distribution:

```{r}
#| echo: false

plot(p, prior, 
     type = "l", 
     ylim = ylim, 
     lwd = 2, 
     xlab = latex2exp::TeX("$\\theta$"), 
     ylab = "Probability")
lines(p, likelihood, col = "black", lwd = 2)
points(d/k, 0, pch = 19, col = "firebrick", cex = 1.5)
lines(p, posterior, lwd = 2, col = "dodgerblue")
legend("topleft", legend = c("Prior", "Likelihood", "Posterior"), fill = c("darkgreen", "black", "dodgerblue"))
points(d/k, 0, pch = 19, col = "firebrick", cex = 1.5)
```

## Bayes Factor

The idea of the Bayes Factor is computing the evidence of the data under two competing hypotheses, $H_0$ and $H_1$ (~ $\theta$ in our previous example):

$$
\frac{p(H_0|D)}{p(H_1|D)} = \frac{f(D|H_0)}{f(D|H_1)} \times \frac{p(H_0)}{p(H_1)}
$$

Where $f$ is the likelihood function, $y$ are the data. The $\frac{p(H_0)}{p(H_1)}$ is the prior odds of the two hypothesis. The Bayes Factor is the ratio between the likelihood of the data under the two hypotheses.

## Bayes Factor using the SDR

Calculating the BF can be problematic in some condition. The SDR is a convenient shortcut to calculate the Bayes Factor [@Wagenmakers2010-fj]. The idea is that the ratio between the prior and posterior density distribution for the $H_1$ is an estimate of the Bayes factor calculated in the standard way.
    
$$
BF_{01} = \frac{p(D|H_0)}{p(D|H_1)} = \frac{p(\theta = x|D, H_1)}{p(\theta = x, H_1)}
$$

Where $\theta$ is the parameter of interest and $x$ is the null value under $H_0$ e.g., 0. and $D$ are the data.

## Bayes Factor using the SDR, Example:

Following the previous example $H_0: \theta = 0.5$. Under $H_1$ we use a completely uninformative prior by setting $\theta \sim Beta(1, 1)$.

We flip again the coin 20 times and we found that $\hat \theta = 0.75$.

```{r}
#| echo: false

curve(dbeta(x, 1, 1), 
      lwd = 2, 
      col = "darkgreen", 
      xlab = latex2exp::TeX("$\\theta$"),
      ylab = "Density",
      main = latex2exp::TeX("Prior distribution for $\\theta$"),
      cex.lab = 1.3,
      cex.main = 1.3,
      cex.axis = 1.3)
```

## Bayes Factor using the SDR, Example:

The ratio between the two black dots is the Bayes Factor.

```{r}
#| echo: false
par(mfrow = c(1,2))

ps <- seq(0, 1, 0.01)

# theta = 0.75

```

::: {.notes}
If the probability density of the null value decrease after seeing data (from prior to posterior) this means that the Bayes factor should favor the alternative hypothesis.
On the left, the density of 0.5 is lower after seeing the data --> evidence for H1
On the right the density of 0.5 is higher after seeing the data --> evidence for H0
:::

## @Verhagen2014-tx model^[see also @Ly2019-ow for an improvement]

The idea is using the posterior distribution of the original study as prior for a Bayesian hypothesis testing where:

- $H_0: \theta_{rep} = 0$ thus there is no effect in the replication study
- $H_1: \theta_{rep} \neq 0$ and in particular is distributed as $\delta \sim \mathcal{N}(\theta_{orig}, \sigma^2_{orig})$ where $\theta_{orig}$ and $\sigma^2_{orig}$ are the mean and standard error of the original study

If $H_0$ is more likely after seeing the data, there is evidence against the replication (i.e., $BF_{r0} > 1$) otherwise there is evidence for a successful replication ($BF_{r1} > 1$).

## @Verhagen2014-tx model

::: {.callout-warning}
**Disclaimer:** The actual implementation of @Verhagen2014-tx is different (they use the $t$ statistics). The proposed implementation for the current workshop use a standard linear model.
:::

## Example

Let's assume that the original study ($n = 30$) estimate a $y_{orig} = 0.4$ and a standard error of $\sigma^2/n$.

```{r}
#| echo: true
# original study
n <- 30
yorig <- 0.4
se <- sqrt(1/30)
```

::: {.callout-note}
The assumption of Verhagen & Wagenmakers (2014) is that the original study performed a Bayesian analysis with a completely flat prior. Thus the confidence interval is the same as the Bayesian credible interval.
:::

## Example

For this reason, the posterior distribution of the original study can be approximated as:

```{r}
#| echo: false
curve(dnorm(x, yorig, se), 
      from = yorig - se*4,
      to = yorig + se*4,
      main = "Original Study Posterior Distribution",
      col = "firebrick3",
      lwd = 3,
      xlab = latex2exp::TeX("$\\delta$"),
      ylab = "Density")
```

::: {.notes}
With an uninformative prior the credible interval is the same as the confidence interval
:::

## Example

Let's imagine that a new study tried to replicate the original one. They collected $n = 100$ participants with the same protocol and found and effect of $y_{rep} = 0.1$.

```{r}
nrep <- 100
yrep <- MASS::mvrnorm(nrep, mu = 0.1, Sigma = 1, empirical = TRUE)[, 1]
dat <- data.frame(y = yrep)
hist(yrep, main = "Replication Study (n1 = 100)", xlab = latex2exp::TeX("$y_{rep}$"))
abline(v = mean(yrep), lwd = 2, col = "firebrick")
```

## Example

We can analyze these data with an *intercept-only regression model* setting as prior the posterior distribution of the original study:

```{r}
#| echo: true

# setting the prior on the intercept parameter
prior <- rstanarm::normal(location = yorig,
                          scale = se)

# fitting the bayesian linear regression
fit <- stan_glm(y ~ 1, 
                data = dat, 
                prior_intercept = prior,
                refresh = FALSE)

summary(fit)
```

## Example

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Results

We can use the `bayestestR::bayesfactor_pointnull()` to calculate the BF using the Savage-Dickey density ratio.

```{r}
bf <- bayestestR::bayesfactor_pointnull(fit, null = 0)
print(bf)
```

### Plot

```{r}
#| echo: true
plot(bf)

## Example

You can also use the `bf_replication()` function:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: asis
filor::print_fun(funs$bf_replication)
```

## Example

```{r}
bf_replication(mu_original = yorig, se_original = se, replication = yrep)

## Ego-Depletion and self-control @Hagger2016-vr

> Self-control has been regarded as an individualâ€™s capacity to actively override or inhibit impulses; suppress urges; resist temptations; and break ingrained, well-learned behaviors or habits [@Hagger2016-vr].

- @Baumeister2007-jb proposed a *limited-resource* model of **self-control**

- The **ego-depletion** effect is a behavioral effect where being engaged in a task requiring *self-control* reduce the strenght of self-control on a subsequent task [@Baumeister2007-jb].

## Ego-Depletion and self-control @Hagger2016-vr

- @Hagger2010-zh published a meta-analysis finding a standardized effect size of $d = 0.62$ ($SE = 0.02$, $95\% CI = [0.57, 0.67]$). They analyzed $k = 198$ studies with a total of $n = 10782$ participants.

- However, @Hagger2016-vr suggest that the effect could be inflated by publication bias and questioned the presence of the effect

- @Hagger2016-vr conducted a multi-lab replication study of the effect. See the OSF project [https://osf.io/4zy8k/](https://osf.io/4zy8k/)

## Ego-Depletion and self-control @Hagger2016-vr

The dataset can be found in `slides/03-replication-methods/objects/hagger2016.rds`:

```{r}
#| echo: false
hagger2016 <- readRDS(here("slides/03-replication-methods/objects/hagger2016.rds"))
hagger2016
```

## Ego-Depletion and self-control @Hagger2016-vr

```{r}
#| echo: false
head(hagger2016)
```

- the `id` is an identifier for the study. Note that 0 is the original meta-analysis while others are the multi-lab replication studies
- `*_exp` and `*_ctrl` are the `m` mean, `sd` standard deviation and `n` sample size of the studies.
- `yi` and `vi` are the effect size and the sampling variance of the studies

This is an interesting situation because we have a highly precise but probably biased original study and a probably unbiased multi-lab replications.

## Gustatory Disgust on Moral Judgment @Ghelfi2020-ee

- Eskine and colleagues [-@Eskine2011-am] found that subjects who drank a bitter beverage before reading six moral vignettes judged the charactersâ€™ actions more harshly than did subjects who drank a sweet beverage or water.
- The found an effect of $d = 1.09$^[We recalculated the effect using `metafor` thus the results could slightly differ]
- @Ghelfi2020-ee conducted a multi-lab study with $k = 11$ laboratories

## Gustatory Disgust on Moral Judgment @Ghelfi2020-ee

The dataset `04-replication-methods/objects/ghelfi2020.rds` contains the original study and the replications:

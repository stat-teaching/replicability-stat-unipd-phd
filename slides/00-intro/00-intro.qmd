## About us {.about}

We are part of the **Psicostat** research group. A interdisciplinary research group interested in Psychology and Statistics. `r icons::fontawesome("globe")` [psicostat.dpss.psy.unipd.it](https://psicostat.dpss.psy.unipd.it/)

| 18/09/2023 | **Statistical Methods for Replicability Assessment** | Frequentist and Bayesian statistical methods for replicability assessment |

## Materials üìò

. . .

- üåê All the **material** (code, slides, extra) are available on the **Github** of the Summer School [https://github.com/replicability-stat-unipd/replicability-summer-school-2023](https://github.com/replicability-stat-unipd/replicability-summer-school-2023). The same material can be accessed using this link [https://replicability-stat-unipd.github.io/replicability-summer-school-2023/](https://replicability-stat-unipd.github.io/replicability-summer-school-2023/)

. . .

- üìù Slides are created with **Quarto**, you can use it as standard slides (in *html* format) and see the source code (`.qmd` file)

. . .

- üíª For code debugging, exercises or general questions we can use this shared online code editor [etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/replicability-summer-school-2023](https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/replicability-summer-school-2023). Basically we can write code together `r emo::ji("smile")`

. . .

- ‚öôÔ∏è We are going to use mainly the slides, R Studio, the Github website and the shared editor. **I suggest you to bookmark the Github website and the editor**

## Disclaimer

. . .

- We are using a lot of (R) code. When talking about code there is no a unique solution or method. My approach is not the best. If your code works, everything good :smile:

. . .

- If we have time, we can discuss about best practice in writing code in terms of efficency, organization and clarity :sunglasses:

. . .

- Also for statistics related topics, there are often multiple options to solve a problem. If you know other alternatives beyond the proposed topics, we can discuss it :wink:

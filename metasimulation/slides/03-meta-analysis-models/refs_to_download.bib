  abstract = {The extent of heterogeneity in a meta-analysis partly determines
  the difficulty in drawing overall conclusions. This extent may be measured by
  estimating a between-study variance, but interpretation is then specific to a
  particular treatment effect metric. A test for the existence of heterogeneity
  exists, but depends on the number of studies in the meta-analysis. We develop
  measures of the impact of heterogeneity on a meta-analysis, from mathematical
  criteria, that are independent of the number of studies and the treatment
  effect metric. We derive and propose three suitable statistics: H is the
  square root of the chi2 heterogeneity statistic divided by its degrees of
  freedom; R is the ratio of the standard error of the underlying mean from a
  random effects meta-analysis to the standard error of a fixed effect
  meta-analytic estimate, and I2 is a transformation of (H) that describes the
  proportion of total variation in study estimates that is due to heterogeneity.
  We discuss interpretation, interval estimates and other properties of these
  measures and examine them in five example data sets showing different amounts
  of heterogeneity. We conclude that H and I2, which can usually be calculated
  for published meta-analyses, are particularly useful summaries of the impact
  of heterogeneity. One or both should be presented in published meta-analyses
  in preference to the test for heterogeneity.},

  abstract = {Formal empirical assessments of replication have recently become
  more prominent in several areas of science, including psychology. These
  assessments have used different statistical approaches to determine if a
  finding has been replicated. The purpose of this article is to provide several
  alternative conceptual frameworks that lead to different statistical analyses
  to test hypotheses about replication. All of these analyses are based on
  statistical methods used in meta-analysis. The differences among the methods
  described involve whether the burden of proof is placed on replication or
  nonreplication, whether replication is exact or allows for a small amount of
  "negligible heterogeneity," and whether the studies observed are assumed to be
  fixed (constituting the entire body of relevant evidence) or are a sample from
  a universe of possibly relevant studies. The statistical power of each of
  these tests is computed and shown to be low in many cases, raising issues of
  the interpretability of tests for replication. (PsycINFO Database Record (c)

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Evaluating the variation in the strength of the effect
  across studies is a key feature of meta-analyses. This variability is
  reflected by measures like Ï„(2) or I(2), but their clinical interpretation is
  not straightforward. A prediction interval is less complicated: it presents
  the expected range of true effects in similar studies. We aimed to show the
  advantages of having the prediction interval routinely reported in
  meta-analyses. DESIGN: We show how the prediction interval can help understand
  the uncertainty about whether an intervention works or not. To evaluate the
  implications of using this interval to interpret the results, we selected the
  first meta-analysis per intervention review of the Cochrane Database of
  Systematic Reviews Issues 2009-2013 with a dichotomous (n=2009) or continuous
  (n=1254) outcome, and generated 95\% prediction intervals for them. RESULTS:
  In 72.4\% of 479 statistically significant (random-effects p0), the 95\%
  prediction interval suggested that the intervention effect could be null or
  even be in the opposite direction. In 20.3\% of those 479 meta-analyses, the
  prediction interval showed that the effect could be completely opposite to the
  point estimate of the meta-analysis. We demonstrate also how the prediction
  interval can be used to calculate the probability that a new trial will show a
  negative effect and to improve the calculations of the power of a new trial.
  CONCLUSIONS: The prediction interval reflects the variation in treatment
  effects over different settings, including what effect is to be expected in
  future patients, such as the patients that a clinician is interested to treat.
  Prediction intervals should be routinely reported to allow more informative
  inferences in meta-analyses.},

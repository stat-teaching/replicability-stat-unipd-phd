  abstract = {Meta-analyses are typically used to estimate the overall/mean of
  an outcome of interest. However, inference about between-study variability,
  which is typically modelled using a between-study variance parameter, is
  usually an additional aim. The DerSimonian and Laird method, currently widely
  used by default to estimate the between-study variance, has been long
  challenged. Our aim is to identify known methods for estimation of the
  between-study variance and its corresponding uncertainty, and to summarise the
  simulation and empirical evidence that compares them. We identified 16
  estimators for the between-study variance, seven methods to calculate
  confidence intervals, and several comparative studies. Simulation studies
  suggest that for both dichotomous and continuous data the estimator proposed
  by Paule and Mandel and for continuous data the restricted maximum likelihood
  estimator are better alternatives to estimate the between-study variance.
  Based on the scenarios and results presented in the published studies, we
  recommend the Q-profile method and the alternative approach based on a
  'generalised Cochran between-study variance statistic' to compute
  corresponding confidence intervals around the resulting estimates. Our
  recommendations are based on a qualitative evaluation of the existing
  literature and expert consensus. Evidence-based recommendations require an
  extensive simulation study where all methods would be compared under the same
  scenarios.},

  abstract = {The meta-analytic random effects model assumes that the
  variability in effect size estimates drawn from a set of studies can be
  decomposed into two parts: heterogeneity due to random population effects and
  sampling variance. In this context, the usual goal is to estimate the central
  tendency and the amount of heterogeneity in the population effect sizes. The
  amount of heterogeneity in a set of effect sizes has implications regarding
  the interpretation of the meta-analytic findings and often serves as an
  indicator for the presence of potential moderator variables. Five population
  heterogeneity estimators were compared in this article analytically and via
  Monte Carlo simulations with respect to their bias and efficiency.},

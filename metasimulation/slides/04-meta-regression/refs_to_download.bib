  abstract = {Factorial experiments in research on memory, language, and in
  other areas are often analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). However,
  for effects with more than one numerator degrees of freedom, e.g., for
  experimental factors with more than two levels, the ANOVA omnibus F-test is
  not informative about the source of a main effect or interaction. Because
  researchers typically have specific hypotheses about which condition means
  differ from each other, a priori contrasts (i.e., comparisons planned before
  the sample means are known) between specific conditions or combinations of
  conditions are the appropriate way to represent such hypotheses in the
  statistical model. Many researchers have pointed out that contrasts should be
  “tested instead of, rather than as a supplement to, the ordinary ‘omnibus’ F
  test” (Hays, 1973, p. 601). In this tutorial, we explain the mathematics
  underlying different kinds of contrasts (i.e., treatment, sum, repeated,
  polynomial, custom, nested, interaction contrasts), discuss their properties,
  and demonstrate how they are applied in the R System for Statistical Computing
  (R Core Team, 2018). In this context, we explain the generalized inverse which
  is needed to compute the coefficients for contrasts that test hypotheses that
  are not covered by the default set of contrasts. A detailed understanding of
  contrast coding is crucial for successful and correct specification in linear
  models (including linear mixed models). Contrasts defined a priori yield far
  more useful confirmatory tests of experimental hypotheses than standard
  omnibus F-tests. Reproducible code is available from https://osf.io/7ukf6/.},

  abstract = {Most textbooks on regression focus on theory and the simplest of
  examples. Real statistical problems, however, are complex and subtle. This is
  not a book about the theory of regression. It is about using regression to
  solve real problems of comparison, estimation, prediction, and causal
  inference. Unlike other books, it focuses on practical issues such as sample
  size and missing data and a wide range of goals and techniques. It jumps right
  in to methods and computer code you can use immediately. Real examples, real
  stories from the authors' experience demonstrate what regression can do and
  its limitations, with practical advice for understanding assumptions and
  implementing methods for experiments and observational studies. They make a
  smooth transition to logistic regression and GLM. The emphasis is on
  computation in R and Stan rather than derivations, with code available online.
  Graphics and presentation aid understanding of the models and model fitting.},

  abstract = {Several methods are available to estimate the total and residual
  amount of heterogeneity in meta-analysis, leading to different alternatives
  when estimating the predictive power in mixed-effects meta-regression models
  using the formula proposed by Raudenbush (1994, 2009). In this paper, a
  simulation study was conducted to compare the performance of seven estimators
  of these parameters under various realistic scenarios in psychology and
  related fields. Our results suggest that the number of studies (k) exerts the
  most important influence on the accuracy of the results, and that precise
  estimates of the heterogeneity variances and the model predictive power can
  only be expected with at least 20 and 40 studies, respectively. Increases in
  the average within-study sample size (N¯) also improved the results for all
  estimators. Some differences among the accuracy of the estimators were
  observed, especially under adverse (small k and N¯) conditions, while the
  results for the different methods tended to convergence for more optimal
  scenarios.},
